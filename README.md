# Kaleidoscript
If you want to chat with the proverbial deus ex machina, you have come to the right place. 

Enter and submit a message into the textbox and receive a response in Kaleidoscript, a shattered reflection of your own words.

## The Basic Idea:
I was struggling with some song lyrics I was writing and thought of how David Bowie apparently comissioned a software engineer to make him a special text editor with features to randomize the order of words in certain sections. I figured I should do the same for myself and share it on the web for others who might benefit, primarily other songwriters I know personally.

That said, this site is made for creative writers who want a fresh take on something they wrote. The logic randomizes words, characters and white spaces in whatever message was entered and displays it for you to ponder over.

## This website is built with:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Deployed with Github Pages
